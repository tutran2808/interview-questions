- Avoid: Deep technical details, complex scenarios
- Include: "Why are you interested?", "Tell me about yourself", compensation discussions

**HIRING MANAGER INTERVIEW:**
- Focus: Role fit, leadership potential, team dynamics, strategic thinking
- Depth: Moderate technical + strong behavioral focus
- Include: Management scenarios, decision-making, conflict resolution
- Avoid: Deep coding or hands-on technical tests

**TECHNICAL/FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT:**
- Focus: Core technical skills, problem-solving, hands-on abilities
- Depth: Deep technical, specific to role requirements
- Include: Technical scenarios, methodology questions, tools/frameworks
- Avoid: Basic behavioral questions, high-level strategy

**PANEL/ONSITE/VIRTUAL ONSITE INTERVIEWS:**
- Focus: Comprehensive evaluation, cultural fit, advanced technical + behavioral
- Depth: Mix of deep technical, complex scenarios, team collaboration
- Include: System design, complex problem-solving, cross-functional scenarios

🚨 **FINAL REMINDER - STAGE DIFFERENTIATION:**

**ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL**: The questions you generate MUST be dramatically different based on the hiring stage. 

- **RECRUITER SCREEN** = Basic, surface-level, qualification questions
- **HIRING MANAGER** = Role fit, leadership, strategic thinking  
- **TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT** = Deep technical, hands-on, problem-solving
- **PANEL/ONSITE** = Comprehensive mix, advanced technical + behavioral
- **EXECUTIVE/FINAL** = Strategic vision, industry knowledge, leadership

DO NOT generate the same types of questions for different stages. Each stage serves a unique purpose in the hiring process.

**REMEMBER**: This is a critical hiring decision. Generate questions that will help identify the best candidate for this specific role and stage.`;
